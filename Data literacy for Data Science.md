## Exercise 2 - Title of the Notebook
Data Science Tools and Exercises

## Exercise 3 - Introduction
This notebook is designed to provide an overview of common tools, languages, and libraries used in Data Science. It also includes some basic arithmetic operations and unit conversions to illustrate coding in Python.

## Exercise 4 - List of Data Science Languages
Some popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
- Python
- R
- SQL
- Julia
- Scala

## Exercise 5 - List of Data Science Libraries
Here are some of the most commonly used libraries in Data Science:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

## Exercise 6 - Table of Data Science Tools

| Tool           | Description                                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Jupyter        | Interactive computing environment                 |
| RStudio        | IDE for R                                          |
| Apache Spark   | Cluster-computing framework                        |
| TensorFlow     | Open-source machine learning framework             |
| Tableau        | Data visualization tool                            |

## Exercise 7 - Arithmetic Expression Examples
Arithmetic expressions are the foundation of data manipulation and analysis in any programming language. Below are examples of how to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication in Python.

## Exercise 8 - Code to Multiply and Add Numbers
```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply and add numbers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
result
```

## Exercise 9 - Code to Convert Minutes to Hours
This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours

## Exercise 10 - Objectives
In this notebook, we will:

- List popular languages for Data Science
- List common Data Science libraries
- Display tools used in Data Science with a table
- Perform arithmetic operations in Python
- Convert units from minutes to hours
